# Transcribe Bentham project

The analysis of this volunteer-driven transcription project found that relying on crowdsourced transcription was efficient, accurate and an effective way to do this kind of work on a large scale. The Transcribe Bentham project is "cost-effective, despite the initial heavy investment" (Causer et al, 2018, p.18)

We also looked a tweet thread from the National Library of Scotland about how they digitize their archival records. What's interesting here is that when we think of digitization, it's not indiscriminate. Experts choose what to digitize from the countless records held in the archives, and then there's the complex process of categorizing the data and adding metadata. Digitizing records is not simply a matter of scanning and uploading; it also has to be in an accessible format.

As a student learning from a distance, I am relying on Carleton's digital resources through its library. There is a vast amount of databases available through the library; I am taking another course for which all of the research papers are available online.

However, there are some limitations. A big one is that some publications have to be checked out as e-books, which means sometime just three or four copies for a class of over 70. 

One section that jumped out on Transcribe Bentham was a comparison of how long it would take to complete the project without volunteers. If all the transcription was done by researchers, the earliest data all pages would be transcribed was 2081 (Causer et all, 2018, p. 16). This is outside of our lifetimes, and brings home the importance of volunteer crowdsourcing.

This is crucial, I think, in looking at this work as essential rather than one option for digitizing a large number of such records. As we see in some other crowdsourced communities, such as Wikipedia, the power of volunteers who are driven by the mission of the project is immense.
